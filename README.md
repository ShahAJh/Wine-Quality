# Wine-Quality
In recent years, the interest in wine has increased, leading to growth of the wine industry. As a consequence, companies are investing in new technologies to improve wine production and selling. The main aim of this project was to develop an approach to predict human wine taste preferences and also to determine wheather can we or not accurately predict the quality of wine based off some of its chemical properties and features. These approaches can help in target marketing by modeling consumer tastes from niche markets.  The dataset was created by P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis and it is openly available from the UCI machine learning repository (UCI, 2015).
